The Credit Card Reader & Logger is a Python-based application that allows users to read data from a credit card's chip, securely log it,
and provide options for viewing and exporting the data. The app uses **AES-256** encryption to store sensitive card information and features automatic updates for easy software management.
The application is packaged as a **Windows executable (.exe)** with an installer for convenient distribution. Feel free to use this in any way as this is just a project of mine that I
wanted to do out of boredom.

This software is **NOT** intended for malicious activities such as: **Fraud, Scams etc.**
